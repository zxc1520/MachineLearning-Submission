       " \" In the latter, as may be remembered, SherlockHolmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to provethat it had been wound up two hours before, and that thereforethe deceased had gone to bed within that time -- a deductionwhich was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case\",\n",

       " ' During all the years that he lived atHorsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town',\n",
       " ' He had agarden and two or three fields round his house, and there hewould take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end hewould never leave his room',\n",
